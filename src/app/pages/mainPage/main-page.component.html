                        Our team is developing a play-to-earn mini-game. However, we decided to take a different approach:
                        first,
                        build a community and raise funds through our token while the game is in development. By joining us,
                        you become our partners.

        <h2>STALKER Tokenomics</h2>
        STALKER Airdrop Event<br><br>
        Our Team will initiate one of the most significant airdrops in crypto history. The total token supply is fixed at
        100,000,000,000 STALKER.<br><br>

        Airdrop Distribution
        60% of the airdrop supply will go to players, with the remaining balance dedicated to market liquidity, ecosystem
        partnerships, grants, community rewards, and other initiatives.<br><br>

        Quarterly Development & Community Engagement
        <ul class="tokenomics-list">
            <li>2024
                TGE event, find liquidity. Initial community build-up and token release.
                Weekly token distributions to active members.
            </li>
            <li>Q1
                Focus on community building, website enhancements, and initial STALKER token distributions to drive early
                engagement.
            </li>
            <li>Q2
                Continue token distributions while developing core game features, with regular community events to boost
                awareness
                and interaction.
            </li>
            <li>Q3
                Launch a closed beta testing phase with select community members to refine game mechanics and gather
                valuable
                feedback. Marketing campaigns to expand community reach.
            </li>
            <li> Q4
                Begin an open beta phase, implementing final refinements based on user feedback. Prepare for the official
                game
                launch, including events and incentives for new and existing players.
            </li>

        </ul>
        Community-Driven Growth
        A growing player base will lead to increased capitalisation and greater value per token. Together, we build a
        sustainable and engaging ecosystem.<br><br>

        No External Investor Influence
        With no reliance on investment firms or VCs, the token’s value is fully community-driven, based on organic demand
        and engagement, empowering each STALKER holder to be a core part of the project's success.<br><br>

        * But remember that, in the beginning, this is simply a meme coin supporting the STALKER project, and 10% of the
        tokens will be sent to the developers of the game STALKER 2: Heart of Chernobyl.
